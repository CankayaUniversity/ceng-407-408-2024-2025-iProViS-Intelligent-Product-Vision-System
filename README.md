iProViS: Intelligent Product Vision System
<h1> Project Description </h1>

<p> This project aims to recognize products in retail sectors such as supermarkets, clothing, food, electronics, and others using computer vision technology instead of barcodes or QR codes. The system is designed to develop a mobile application that allows users to access product price information, compare prices across different stores, obtain product content information with multilingual support, and gain detailed insights about products. </p>

<p> Additionally, a new framework has been proposed for recyclable product packaging. The recognized product is integrated into the intelligent recycling process by determining its type through the API of the iPRoVis system and incorporating information such as weight when empty or full. This feature enables users to save time by having their discarded packaging recognized and sorted by smart recycling machines during the recycling process. The developed system not only enhances consumer experience but also contributes significantly to sustainability and environmentally friendly approaches within green IT strategy. </p> </br>
